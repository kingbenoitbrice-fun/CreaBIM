# Handles and grips

A selected element shows small handles you can drag to change it directly, in 3D, plans and sections.

- **Square grips** move a point: a wall's ends, a slab's or roof's corners and edge midpoints, a beam's ends, a grid line's ends, a column's base, a stair's start, a railing's points.
- **Round handles** change a size: a wall's height and faces, a door's or window's jambs (width), head and sill, a column's top.

Grips snap to what they land on, and the readout shows the new value. Every drag is one undo step.

## Turning, sliding and sizing

- A selected **object** (furniture or a fixture) has a square grip in front of it: drag it round to turn the object about its middle, in steps of 5°. The arrow beside it turns it round to face the other way.
- A **column** has a turning grip beside it, and round grips on its sides for its width and depth (a round column's diameter); it stays on its point.
- A **stair** has a turning grip behind its first riser.
- A **door or window** has a round grip in its middle to slide it along its wall at the same width; a **beam** has a round grip on its side for its width.
- A **wall** has a round grip off the face opposite its thickness grip: drag it to slide the whole wall square to itself, and the walls joined to it stretch to stay joined. Right-click a wall and pick *Split wall here* to make two walls meeting at that point; doors and windows stay where they are.

## Walls stay joined

Drag a wall's end and the walls joined to it follow, so the corner stays closed. To drag an end on its own, hold `Ctrl` or `Alt` while dragging, or disallow the join at that end (see [Walls](walls#joins)).

## Outline corners

Slabs, roofs, shafts, sketches and railing paths all show the same grips on their outline: a square on each corner to move it and, on a closed outline, a round grip on each edge to push it. To add or remove corners, or reshape holes, open the element in [Edit mode](edit-mode) (`Enter` or a double-click): pick corners and press `Delete`, drag a ◇ to add one, or right-click for more.

Rest the pointer on any grip for a tip saying what it does. During a drag, press `Tab` to type a length.

## Shafts

A selected shaft has a square grip on each corner, a round one on each edge and round grips for its base and its top, in every plan, section and 3D view it passes through.

## In sections

Select an element in a section: its plan grips slide along the section line, and its height grips move up and down.

## Section and elevation lines

Select a section or elevation mark in a plan: the square handles move its ends, the round middle handle moves the whole line, and the handle on the shaded band sets how deep it sees. See [Sections and elevations](sections).

## Crop boxes

A selected crop box has round handles on its faces and a square handle at its corner to move it. See [Crop boxes](crop-boxes).
