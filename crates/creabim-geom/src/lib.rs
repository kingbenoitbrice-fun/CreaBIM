//! Geometry for CreaBIM: turns model elements into triangle meshes for the
//! viewport and into 2D linework for plan drawings.
//!
//! This crate is the seam where a full B-rep kernel (OpenCascade) plugs in
//! later. Architectural elements in the prototype are boxes, extrusions and
//! polygon meshes, which this crate builds exactly.
