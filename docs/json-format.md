# The CreaBIM model JSON format

A plain JSON file that describes a building model: levels, grids, walls
with their types and layers, doors and windows placed by wall and offset,
slabs with holes, roofs, columns, beams, stairs, railings, extrusions and
sweeps, site elements, furniture from the catalogue, rooms, views and
sheets with views placed on them. Any script, in any language, can write
one, and the `creabim` command-line tool turns it into a project you can
open in the app. Nothing has to be compiled against CreaBIM's code.

```sh
creabim build house.json house.creabim     # build a project
creabim build --check house.json           # only check the file
creabim export-json house.creabim out.json # describe a project in the format
creabim json-schema creabim-model.schema.json
```

The format has a JSON Schema, [`creabim-model.schema.json`](creabim-model.schema.json).
Point an editor at it with a `"$schema"` field, and it completes and checks
the field names as you type. A bigger example, a small house with a site,
furniture and three sheets, is [`examples/small-house.json`](../examples/small-house.json).

## A full small example

A one-room studio on a level, with a door, two windows, a floor, a gable
roof, a plan, a section, a 3D view, a door schedule and one sheet.

## How a file is put together

- **The top level** is an object with a `version` (required) and lists:
  `materials`, `assemblies`, `types`, `levels`, `grid_groups`, `grids`,
  `walls`, `openings`, `slabs`, `roofs`, `columns`, `beams`, `stairs`,
  `railings`, `parts`, `site`, `objects`, `rooms`, `views`, `sheets`,
  `tags` and `notes`.
  Every list may be left out, and the lists may come in any order.
- **Ids.** Every element has an `id` you choose: any non-empty string,
  unique across the whole file (a wall and a view can't share one). Elements
  refer to each other by these ids: a door names its wall, a plan names its
  level, a viewport names its view. The id also names the element in the app
  unless you give a `name`. A sheet's id is its number ("A101").
- **References are checked by kind.** A door's `wall` must be the id of a
  wall, not of a level. An element may refer to one listed after it.
- **Units.** Lengths are in metres. A top-level `"units"` of `"mm"`, `"cm"`,
  `"ft"` or `"in"` makes every length in the file that unit instead. Angles
  (pitch, rotation, direction, azimuth) are always degrees. Positions and
  sizes on sheets (`at`, a sheet's `width` and `height`) are always paper
  millimetres. `display_units` only sets how the app shows lengths.
- **Points** are arrays: `[x, y]` in plan (x east, y north), `[x, y, z]`
  in space, `z` above the element's level.
- **Heights hang off levels.** Every building element names its `level`;
  its heights (`base_offset`, a slab's `top_offset`, a railing's path `z`)
  are measured from that level's elevation, so moving a level in the app
  moves what is on it.
- **Types.** A wall, door, window, slab, roof, column or beam may name a
  `type`; it then takes the type's values, and any value it gives itself
  overrides the type's for that element only (as in the app).
- **Defaults.** A field with a default may be left out. The reference
  below gives each one.
- **Colours** are `"#rrggbb"`, or `[r, g, b]` from 0 to 1.
- **No nulls.** Leave a field out instead of writing `null`.

### Placing things

- A wall runs along its **centreline** from `start` to `end`. Its exterior
  face is on its right, looking from start to end, unless `flip` is set.
  Give `top_level` to tie its top to a level (it then follows that level),
  or a `height`; left out, it is as tall as its level's `height`.
- An opening sits in its `wall`, `offset` along it from the wall's start to
  the opening's near edge, or with `centre` to its middle. `sill` is its
  bottom above the wall's base.
- A slab's outline is the slab's edge in plan; its top face is
  `top_offset` above its level and it is `thickness` deep below that.
- A roof's outline is the wall plate, where the slopes start; `overhang`
  reaches past it. A shed roof rises from outline edge `edge`; a gable
  roof's ridge runs along it.
- An object from the catalogue is placed by its origin, the middle of its
  back edge (or by its middle, with `"anchor": "centre"`); at a `rotation`
  of 0 its back is towards +y (north). `creabim catalogue` lists the keys.
- A room is the space the walls close off round its `at` point, unless
  you give it an `outline`.
- A section or elevation looks to the left of its line: a line drawn west
  to east (`[0, 0]` to `[10, 0]`) looks north.
- A viewport puts a view's drawing on a sheet: `at` is where on the sheet
  (mm from its lower left corner), `target` the drawing point that goes
  there (left out: the middle of the crop, or of the whole drawing), `crop`
  the part of the drawing shown.

## Checking a file

`creabim build --check file.json` reads the file and builds the model in
memory, and reports every problem it finds, each at its JSON path:

```text
house.json: $.walls[3].thikness: unknown field `thikness`: did you mean `thickness`?
house.json: $.openings[0].wall: there is no wall with the id "W9"; did you mean "W1"?
house.json: $.openings[2]: it runs from 3.600 to 4.500 m along its wall, which is 4.200 m long
house.json: $.views[1].level: `level` is not used by a section view
4 problems; nothing was built
```

Fields the format doesn't know are errors, never ignored, so a misspelt
field can't silently fall back to its default. An element with a problem
is left out of the check that follows, so what refers to it doesn't repeat
the message. Problems with the file's shape (unknown fields, wrong types,
missing fields) are reported first; what refers to what is checked once
the shape is right. A file with problems builds nothing; the command fails with a
non-zero exit code, which makes it usable in a script or a CI job.

Some things build but look wrong; those are printed as warnings (a window
whose top is above its wall's).

## Exporting

`creabim export-json project.creabim out.json` writes a project in the
format, ids made from the elements' names (with `-2`, `-3` added where
names repeat). Building the exported file gives back the same model for
everything the format covers: exporting that again gives the same file.
What the format can't describe yet is left out and listed on the terminal,
for example:

```text
left out: 14 Tag (annotation is not in the format yet)
left out: the title block template of 12 sheets (they get the built-in one)
```

## Versions and what comes next

The format is versioned by the top-level `version`. This is version 1.
CreaBIM refuses a file of a newer version with a message naming the version,
rather than misreading it. New elements and fields are added to the format
as new optional fields and lists, so a version 1 file stays valid; a change
that would make an existing file mean something else raises the version.

### Not yet in the format

These exist in CreaBIM but can't be written in a file yet. A model made
from a file can have them added in the app, and `export-json` lists any it
leaves out.

- Annotation: dimensions, spot levels, text styles, a tag's room fields,
  and note leaders that point at an element (rather than a place).
- Title block templates (sheets get the built-in title block) and mark
  numbering rules.
- Per-view settings: visibility (hidden categories and elements), plan
  graphics and view range, underlays, level heads, crop boxes of 3D views,
  view templates and style packs.
- Curtain walls and curtain wall types, and openings in curtain walls.
- Footings, shafts, ceilings, room separators, sketches, guides, free
  meshes (with their modifiers) and booleans between elements.
- Objects other than the starter catalogue's (a catalogue folder of your
  own, or objects imported from Blender, FreeCAD or IFC), and footing types.
- Wall joins switched off at a wall's end.
- Join rules between walls (which wall cuts which, cleanup switched off)
  and 2D detail components drawn in detail views. Callout views and layer
  join priorities are in the format.
- Elements added by work in progress (graphic styles and view ranges)
  will join the format as they land.

## Reference

Every object of the format, field by field. This section is made from the
same declarations the reader uses, so it can't drift from what CreaBIM
accepts; the schema is made from them too.
